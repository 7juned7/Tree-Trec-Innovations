        <h2>About Tree Trec </h2>
        <p>
          Coconut is a cash crop which predominantly grows in tropical habitats.
          According to the Food and Agriculture organization Corporate
          Statistical Database 63.68 million metric tonnes of coconuts were
          produced globally in 2021 out of which Indiaâ€™s contribution was about
          22.47%. In India coconuts are mainly produced in the southern states
          like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, etc. The harvesting of coconuts is done
          manually by climbing the trees which is a very labour-intensive
          process and poses a serious threat to the life of the climber in case
          of any mishap like falling off from the tree. It is therefore
          necessary to develop alternate methods of harvesting which reduce the
          role of humans and use robots which are capable of climbing the trees
          and harvesting the crop. These methods should also increase the
          farmers income, reduce harvesting time. The coconuts can be harvested
          using a semi-autonomous robot. The robot will be capable of climbing
          the tree and then harvesting the coconuts
